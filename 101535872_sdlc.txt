DevOps plays a critical role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by enabling continuous integration, automated testing, and rapid deployment. It helps improve collaboration between developers and operations teams, reducing development cycles and increasing software reliability. By integrating DevOps, organizations achieve faster releases, improved scalability, and more secure applications.
